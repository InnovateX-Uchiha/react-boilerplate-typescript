## Ongoing Work

In between [releases](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate-typescript/releases), we work on the `dev` branch and rarely ever update `master`. For that reason, it sometimes look like the repo isn't actively maintained. This isn't the case, React Boilerplate is alive and kicking.

Please feel free to check out:

- our [`dev` branch](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate-typescript/tree/dev) for the latest updates. You are always welcome to use it as the basis for your project. We only merge to `dev` projects which are fully ready.
- our open [issues](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and [pull requests](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to see what we are currently working on. Suggestions and contributions are always welcome!
